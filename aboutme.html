			<p> My name is Mark Litfin. I am a technology and fitness enthusiast and IT professional. I have worked as a contractor in the government space for the past 4 years which has given me the experience necessary to work in the technology field. I have been heavily involved in testing during the Software Development Lifecycle(SDLC) and have helped with configurations when necessary to get the specified products or upgrades ready for deployment/go-live.<br><br>I have spent much of my spare time over the past few years furthering my education in the technology field. This includes finishing my second bachelors degree in CyberSecurity and Networking, studying for and obtaining 4 different certifications in the field, taking online and in person continuing education classes in various programming languages with a focus on web development, and working on various personal projects which include applications and game development.</p>

		<h2>Hobbies</h2>
			<p>From a young age I had two main interests, this was technology and sports. I ended up gravitating towards sports as I got older and into college age which led me to major in Exercise Science as my first degree. I ended up obtaining 2 trainer certifications in health and fitness but after pursuing success this field for a few years I realized I didn't like certain aspects of it and decided I would much rather keep sports and exercise a hobby. This is when I went back to school to pursue a second degree in IT.<br><br>I do not regret pursuing the exercise science field as it gave me useful leadership and life skills. I currently use that knowledge I learned to pursue my main hobby of competitive bodybuilding and weight lifting. I currently compete in 2-3 bodybuilding or powerlifting competions per year and run in endurance or OCR races with friends in between. I also play soccer or any other sport I get an opportunity for throughout the year. During the summer I enjoy beach vacations and just being outdoors as much as I can. I do not often play video games, but a new hobby I have developed now that I have a knowledge base of a few programming languages is creating them. I am currently working on multiple games that I had dreamed up when I was younger and feeling the excitement of coming up with new ideas and putting them into action.</p>
